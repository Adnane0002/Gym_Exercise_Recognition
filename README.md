# Gym Exercise Recognition
This project aims to recognize various sports movements using AI on a microcontroller. This field is known as Embedded Machine Learning.

This projects was reduces to on a classification problem. There are five classes : Squats, shoulder lifts, arm stretches, Standing and Nobody.

The setup is based on a ST  VL53L5CX Time-of-Flight sensor (8x8 LiDAR sensor), operates on an Arduino UNO R4 and utilizes NanoEdge AI Studio, a user-friendly platform for AI on microcontrollers, to log data, train the model, and test it. Additionally, it is compatible with any microcontroller that has an Arm Cortex-M architecture.
